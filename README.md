# 🧠 Simple Typing Speed Tester

This is a simple Python-based typing speed tester built using Jupyter Notebook. The tester challenges users to type a randomly chosen sentence within a set time limit (default: 30 seconds) and evaluates both their speed and accuracy.

## 📋 Features

- Displays a random sentence to type  
- Starts timing once you press Enter  
- Measures:
  - Words per minute (WPM)
  - Accuracy in percentage
  - Time taken vs time limit
- Clean markdown-based display in the notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `Augmented Experiment Final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells and follow the prompts in the output

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `IPython.display` (usually comes with Jupyter)

Install Jupyter if you don’t have it:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## 📌 Usage

```python
target_time = 30  # You can change this to your preferred limit
calculate_typing_speed(target_time)
```

## 📈 Example Output

- Accuracy: 92.3%  
- Words per minute: 45.6  
- Time taken: 25.3 seconds  
- Result: You were **4.7 seconds faster** than your target time!
